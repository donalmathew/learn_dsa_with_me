#### 1. Steps to follow:
1. State the problem clearly.
2. Come up with some example inputs and outpts. try to cover all edge cases.
3. come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.
4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs if any.
5. Analyse the algorithms complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.
6. apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3-6.

>**Default mindset to have while coding:** Assume always that the code that we write is going to have errors. In this way, we can avoid panic while not getting an error and open our mind to new solutions.
